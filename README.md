<small><sup>These are exercises related to Java inheritance and polymorphism,Java inheritance and polymorphism exercises focus on the use of base classes to define new derived classes, thus leveraging the functionality already defined in the base classes and adding or modifying specific characteristics. Additionally, the concept of polymorphism is explored, where a derived class can be treated as if it were a base class, allowing code reuse and increasing program flexibility. These exercises help develop skills in class design, managing the inheritance hierarchy, and implementing object-oriented programming logic in Java.</sup></small><br>
